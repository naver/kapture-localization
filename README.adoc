== Overview

kapture-localization is a **toolbox** in which you will find implementations for various localization related algorithms.
It strongly relies on the https://github.com/naver/kapture[kapture] format for data representation and manipulation.

The localization algorithms include:

 . **mapping**,
 . **localization**, and
 . **benchmarking** (image retrieval for visual localization).

It works on Ubuntu, Windows, and MacOS.

== Structure

The directories are organised as follow:

----
├── kapture_localization/  # package (library)
├── pipeline/              # main programs executing all steps of the localization pipelines
├── samples/               # some sample data
├── tests/                 # unit tests
└── tools/                 # sub programs involved in the pipeline
----


The __kapture-localization__ toolbox is available as:

 - Python *package* (`kapture_localization/`),
 - Python *executable scripts* (`pipeline/` & `tools/`).

There are 3 pipelines available:

 . mapping,
 . localization, and
 . image retrieval benchmark (global sfm, local sfm, pose approximation).


== Installation

It can be installed using docker, pip or from manually from source code.
After installing python (>=3.8) and COLMAP (>=3.6), this toolbox can be installed with:

[source,bash]
----
pip install kapture-localization
----

See link:doc/installation.adoc[] for more details.

== Tutorial

See link:doc/tutorial.adoc[doc/tutorial] for a short introduction and examples of the provided processing pipelines.

== Contributing

There are many ways to contribute to the __kapture-localization__ project:

* provide feedback and suggestion,
* submit bug reports in the project bug tracker,
* implement a feature or bug-fix for an outstanding issue,
* provide scripts to create data in kapture format (e.g. local/global feature extraction),
* propose a new feature and implement it.
